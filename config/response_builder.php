	|
	| This option controls code range allowed error codes to use. This is
	| helpful when you use i.e. many chained APIs and you would like to ensure
	| all error codes are unique. By assigning different ranges to your API
	| and by properly setting min_code and max_code you have this guarded
	| by ResponseBuilder at runtime.
	|
	| NOTE ResponseBuilder reserves codes from 0 to 63 (inclusive) for own
	| internal use, and your codes cannot use this range.
	|
	| min_code - Min error code assigned for this module (inclusive)
	| max_code - Max error code assigned for this module (inclusive)

	| standard Laravel's Lang

	|
	| If you do not have
	| dedicated message for error code, you still must have put the code here
	| but you can set null as string, i.e.:
	|
	|    ErrorCodes::SOMETHING => null,
