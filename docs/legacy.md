![REST API Response Builder for Laravel](img/laravel-logolockup-rgb-red.png)

# Using legacy PHP or Laravel versions #

 Beginning version 6.0, `ResponseBuilder` no longer supports older versions of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) than 6.0 (which also means it now requires
 PHP 7.2 or newer). If your project uses older versions of Laravel or PHP, use `ResponseBuilder` 4.x which is compatible with Laravel 5.1+ and older
 versions of PHP. Please note that 4.x is no longer maintained, so you should consider upgrading your project anyway.
