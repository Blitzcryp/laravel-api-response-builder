![REST API Response Builder for Laravel](img/logo.png)

# Legacy support #

 Beginning version 6.0, `ResponseBuilder` requires [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) v6 or newer and therefore `ResponseBuilder`
 also requires PHP 7.2, same as Laravel. If you cannot upgrade for any reason, you can still use legacy `ResponseBuilder` v4,
 which supports Laravel 5.1+ and PHP 5.1 and up.
 
     composer require marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder "^4.0" 
  
 or edit your `composer.json` manually and add following line to `require` section:

    "marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder": "^4.0",
